//Problem 405 - Convert a number to hexadecimal

// Given an integer, write an algorithm to convert it to hexadecimal. 
// For negative integer, twoâ€™s complement method is used.

/*
    All letters in hexadecimal (a-f) must be in lowercase.
    The hexadecimal string must not contain extra leading 0s. If the number is zero, it is represented by a single zero character '0'; otherwise, the first character in the hexadecimal string will not be the zero character.
    The given number is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
    You must not use any method provided by the library which converts/formats the number to hex directly.

//Example
/*
Input:
26

Output:
"1a"

Input:
-1

Output:
"ffffffff"

/*
Explanation:
    We first declare a mapping of an integer to its equivalent hex character in a character vector hex
    If input num is 0, simply return "0"
    Now, store the input num into an unsigned integer n, this would convert a negative value to its two's complement
    Next, run a while loop until n > 0
    Append the character corresponding to n % 16 to the result string and then divide n by 16
    Return the result
